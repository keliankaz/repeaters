# SAFOD Repeaters Analysis

This project analyzes repeating earthquakes (repeaters) in the creeping section of the San Andreas Fault. The analyses are presented in the following notebooks: 

- `SAFOD_repeaters.ipynb`: Analysis of microseismicity near the SAFOD (Fig. 3).
- `manuscript_figures.ipynb`: Analysis of all repeaing earthquakes in the catalog along the creeping section (Figs. 2 and S1).
- `subduction_zone.ipynb`: Analysis of neiboring subduction zone earthquakes (Fig. 4)

## Dependencies

The dependencies are listed in the `requirements.yml` file. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
conda activate repeaters
```

## Dataset

The analysis uses an updated catalog for the creeping section of the San Andreas Fault. The catalog preparation details are described in:

The historical record of subduction zone earthquakes is from:
